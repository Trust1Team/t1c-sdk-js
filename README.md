# Trust1Connector JavaScript SDK
[![][t1c-logo]][Trust1Connector-url]

The Trust1Connector SDK (t1c-sdk-js), is a javascript library to facilitate the integration with the Trust1Connector. The library simplifies the execution to the connector and works asynchronously.
This is version 3 of the library, and is intended to be used with Trust1Connector v3+. For previous versions (v1 and v2), please refer to: [t1c-lib-js (v1/v2)][Trust1Connector-archived-t1c-lib]

When the Trust1Connector isn’t installed the library will return an uninitialised client which can be used to download a client installer.

## Documentation
Documentation is available on [gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/@t1t/s/t1c-js-guide-v3/).

## Backwards compatibility
The library will detect the installed version of Trust1Connector and will only function with version 3.0.0 and higher.

If you have version 1/2.x.x installed you have two options:

  * Upgrade to version 3+ (recommended)
  * Use an older version of the library by running:

```bash
$ npm i trust1connector@2.4.3
```
> __For security reasons v1 and v2 are deprecated__

## Community
We're present on Gitter in the following room:
[Trust1Connector-gitter]

## Build from source
[on Mac M2] Make sure you install perl
```shell
brew install perl
```
and update hte .zshrc

Node version 19

### Install webpack
```shell
npm install --global webpack
```

To build the Trust1Connector JS SDK yourself you need to do the following:
```shell script
$ yarn 
// or 
$ npm install
```
```shell script
$ yarn build-prod
// or
$ npm run build-prod
```
The outcome can be found in the folders
* dist
* lib
* lib-esm

Starting from node 17 the OpenSSL provider has been updated. To build the SDK export the following variable
```shell
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```


## Development
Verify the dependencies, actual vs new versions
```shell script
npm outdated
```
To build the library locally
```bash
yarn build-dev
```
This will create a T1CSdk.js in the dist folder

## Installation - OSX Only
Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine. Use of Yarn is recommended but not required.

### Webpack
Webpack is needed to build the Javascript library
```bash
$ npm install --global webpack
```

### Dependencies
Navigate to the root directory and use Yarn to download and the necessary dependencies
```bash
$ yarn
```
### OR
Use npm install
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Publish to NPM
First make sure you have build prod
```shell
npm install build-prod
```

To publish to NPM you need to be logged in to the Trust1Team NPM account. You can do this by running:
publish will by default add the `latest` tag.
```bash
npm publish
```
to push with a specific tag use 
```shell
npm publish --tag some-tag-name
```
